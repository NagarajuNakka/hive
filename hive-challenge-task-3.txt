1)INNER JOIN
hive> SELECT *
    > FROM order
    > INNER JOIN customers
    > ON order.customer_id=customers.id;
--returned all the common records between two tables
2)LEFT OUTER JOIN
hive> SELECT *
    > FROM order
    > LEFT JOIN customers
    > ON order.customer_id=customers.id;
--returned all the records from left tables and also matchng records from right table
3)RIGHT OUTER JOIN
hive> SELECT *
    > FROM order
    > RIGHT JOIN customers
    > ON order.customer_id=customers.id;
--returned all the records from Rright tables and also matchng records from left table
4)FULL OTER JOIN
hive> SELECT *
    > FROM order
    > FULL OUTER JOIN customers
    > ON order.customer_id=customers.id;
--returned all the matching records and non matching records from left and right table 




BUILD A DATA PIPELINE WITH HIVE
1. Create a hive table as per given schema in your dataset
	 create table AirQuality
    >  (
    > Date timestamp,
    > Time timestamp,
    > CO_GT float,
    > PT08_S1_CO int,
    > NMHC_GT int,
    > C6H6_GT float,
    > PT08_S2_NMHC int,
    > NOx_GT int,
    > PT08_S3_NMHC int,
    > NO2_GT int,
    > PT08_S4_N02 int,
    > PT08_S5_03 int,
    > T float,
    > RH float,
    > AH float
    > )
    > ROW FORMAT DELIMITED
    > FIELDS TERMINATED BY ','
    > STORED AS TEXTFILE
    > TBLPROPERTIES("skip.header.line.count"="1");

2. try to place a data into table location
	load data local inpath '/home/cloudera/AirQuality.xlsx' into table AirQuality;
3. Perform a select operation .
	select * from airquality;
4.Fetch the result of the select operation in your local as a csv file
	hive> INSERT OVERWRITE LOCAL DIRECTORY '/home/raj_ops'
    	    > select * from AirQuality;
5.Perform group by operation
	select * from airquality group by date;
6.Perform filter operation at least 5 kinds of filter examples
	1.select * from airquality where date='2004-03-10 00:00:00'
	2.select * from airquality where date between '2004-03-10 00:00:00' and '2005-05-10 00:00:00';
	3.select * from airquality where PT08_S1_CO in (1000,882,864);
	4.select * from airquality where PT08_S1_CO like '88%'
	5. select * from airquality where PT08_S1_CO is null;
7.how and example of regex operation
	select * from airquality where PT08_S1_CO REGEXP '^16';
8.alter table operation 
	alter table AirQuality drop column T;
9.order by operation 
	select * from airquality order by date;
10.where clause operations you have to perform
	select * from airquality where R=100;
11.sorting operation you have to perform 
	select * from airquality order by date desc;
12.distinct operation you have to perform 
	select distinct(T) from airquality
13.like an operation you have to perform
	select * from airquality where R like '8%'
14.union operation you have to perform
	hive> select date from airquality
    	> union
    	> select T from airquality;
15.table view operation you have to perform .
	create view qir as select date,T from airquality where PT08_S1_CO like '88%';
16. drop table operation
	 drop table qirquality;
